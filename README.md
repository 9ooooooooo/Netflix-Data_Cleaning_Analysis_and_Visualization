# Netflix: Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization

---

## üéØ Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to clean, analyze, and visualize Netflix‚Äôs dataset (2008‚Äì2021) to uncover meaningful insights about movies and TV shows on the platform. By applying data cleaning techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization methods, the project seeks to identify content trends, popular genres, country contributions, and growth patterns, while strengthening practical skills in data preprocessing, analysis, and business intelligence storytelling.

---

## üñäÔ∏è Objectives
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation:</br>
The first objective is to prepare the Netflix dataset (2008‚Äì2021) for meaningful analysis. This involves treating missing values, removing duplicate records, correcting inconsistent formats (such as dates, durations, and text fields), and splitting or merging columns where necessary. A clean dataset ensures accuracy and reliability of the insights generated.</br>

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</br>
The project aims to explore the dataset systematically to identify patterns and distributions. This includes analyzing the proportion of movies vs. TV shows, the frequency of different ratings, the most common genres, the directors with the most titles, and the countries contributing the most content. EDA provides an initial understanding of the data before diving into deeper insights.</br>

3. Trend Analysis:</br>
Another key objective is to identify how Netflix‚Äôs content has evolved over time. By examining yearly and monthly release trends, the project uncovers how the platform has expanded globally, which periods show higher content additions, and how TV shows and movies have grown differently over the years. This helps in understanding Netflix‚Äôs growth strategy and audience targeting.</br>

4. Visualization and Storytelling:</br>
Data visualization is essential for turning raw numbers into meaningful narratives. The project focuses on creating clear, visually appealing graphs, charts, and dashboards using Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Tableau. These visuals not only summarize complex data but also make insights easier to communicate to stakeholders or non-technical audiences.</br>

5. Insight Generation:</br>
A major objective is to generate actionable insights from the analysis. This includes identifying which genres dominate Netflix, which countries produce the most content, how ratings are distributed, and which directors are most featured. These insights can help understand global entertainment trends and content strategies.</br>

6. Skill Development:</br>
Beyond the dataset itself, the project is designed to strengthen technical and analytical skills. By working with Python, the project builds practical experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and business intelligence storytelling‚Äîskills that are directly applicable in data science and analytics roles.</br>

## üîë Key Processes
1. Data Collection and Loading:</br>
The project begins with importing the Netflix dataset (2008‚Äì2021) into Python for analysis. The dataset contains information such as title, type (Movie/TV Show), director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, and listed genres. This raw data serves as the foundation for further cleaning and analysis.</br>

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:</br>
To make the dataset analysis-ready, missing values are treated, duplicate entries are removed, and data types are corrected (e.g., converting date_added to datetime). Columns are also split or standardized, such as extracting year, month, and day from the date_added field, and transforming listed_in into a usable list of genres. This ensures the dataset is consistent, accurate, and reliable.</br>

3. Feature Engineering and Transformation:</br>
Additional features are created to enhance the depth of analysis. Examples include deriving the number of genres per title, calculating movie durations in minutes, and grouping data by year, month, and country. These transformations enrich the dataset and enable more meaningful exploratory analysis.</br>

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization:</br>
Using Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Tableau dashboards, the dataset is explored visually to identify key patterns. This includes analyzing the distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows, top genres, most active directors, content growth trends over years/months, and contributions from different countries. Visual storytelling plays a critical role in highlighting these insights effectively.</br>

5. Interpretation:</br>
The final process focuses on interpreting the results to generate actionable insights. For instance, identifying the rise in Netflix content additions over time, the dominance of certain genres like Drama and Comedy, the strong contribution of countries like the USA and India, and the popularity of certain ratings such as TV-MA. These insights provide a deeper understanding of Netflix‚Äôs content strategy and audience engagement trends.</br>
